Hello, my name is Joey.  I am a computer science and video game desgin teacher for high school 
students.  Before, becoming a teacher I was an Animator for the History Channel and worked on 
the TV show "Jurassic Fight Club".  My hobbies include Video games, and shooting(clay, paper 
and steel. No animals).

Additionally, I am a huge movie buff.  I like to catch each new blockbuster in the theatre when I can, but I have an overall eclectic taste in the films I watch.
