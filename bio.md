Hello, my name is Joey.  I am a computer science and video game desgin teacher for high school 
students.  Before, becoming a teacher I was an Animator for the History Channel and worked on 
the TV show "Jurassic Fight Club".  My hobbies include Video games, and shooting(clay, paper 
and steel. No animals).

Additionally, I am a huge movie buff.  I like to catch each new blockbuster in the theatre when I
can, but I have an overall eclectic taste in the films I watch.

I have studied martial arts of varying types for the majority of my life.  In years past this would
have been one of the first things I would mention but I haven't been involved for the last 4 years.
The last style I studied was Capoeira.


Programming Background:

I have recently been learning C++ as part of this program with OSU.

I teach Java in Pre-AP and AP computer science classes.

I teach C# as part of Unity 3D for my video game design course.

I have some experience with JavaScript from a web design course I used to teach, but the class
focused primarily on HTML and CSS.

Despite the expereince that is displayed, I have to say that I do not have a lot of experience and
that is why I am back in school.
